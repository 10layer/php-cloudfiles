<h2>Demonstrating how to use the PHP Cloud Files API</h2>
<p>
This is a simple web page intended to demonstrate how a Cloud Files user
could use a script to "list" the contents of a Container and present
links for each storage Object.
</p>

<p>
Let's assume you have a valid Cloud Files account and a Container named "IMAGES"
that you use to store media files that you want to make visible to visitors.
You also want to serve the files directly from Cloud Files rather store them on
your web server.  For this example, we'll also assume you were to use the
included SAMPLE Apache configuration file to run a new Virtual Host on
port 4512 (setting up the vhost is beyond the scope of this example - see the
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/">Apache Documentation</a> for detailed
instructions).
</p>

<p>
The accompanying PHP script, <tt>display.php</tt>, must be edited to store your
Cloud Files user information and the <em>$CFS_CONTAINER</em> variable to
"IMAGES".  For this example, let's assume you have a picture of your
dog (<tt>fido.jpg</tt>) and a video of yourself dancing in front of your web
cam (<tt>disco.avi</tt>) stored in your "IMAGES" Container.
</p>

<p>
Here are links that you could put in a static HTML page (such as this one) that
would use the <tt>display.php</tt> script to fetch the content from Cloud Files and
stream it back to the visitor's browser:<br />&nbsp;<br />
This is the <a href="/">web page</a> you're currently viewing.<br />
See my <a href="/display.php?display=fido.jpg">dog</a>.<br />
Watch me <a href="/display.php?display=disco.avi">dance</a>!<br />
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>http://your_server_name_or_ip:4512/</b>:
    would see this HTML page.</li>
<li><b>http://your_servername_or_ip:4512/display.php?display=fido.jpg</b>:
    would see the picture of your dog streamed from Cloud Files directly to the
    browser if it's Content-Type was set correctly when uploading into Cloud Files
    (no intermediate caching of the image on your server).</li>
<li><b>http://your_servername_or_ip:4512/display.php?display=disco.avi</b>:
    would see you shake your groove-thang streamed from Cloud Files directly to
    the browser if it's Content-Type was set correctly when uploading into
    Cloud Files (no intermediate caching of the image on your server).</li>
<li><b>http://your_servername_or_ip:4512/display.php</b>:
    with no query parameters, vistiors would see dynamically generated URLs
    for fido.jpg and disco.avi.</li>
</ul>
